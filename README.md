# domain-event-demo
- This is a simple demo project to illustrate the concept of Domain Events in software design. Domain Events are a way to capture and communicate significant occurrences within a domain, allowing different parts of the system to react to these events in a decoupled manner.
- Domain Events can help improve the maintainability and scalability of an application by promoting a more modular architecture.
- By using spring-boot and spring-events, this demo showcases how to implement Domain Events in a Java application.
